    <p id="vardi">I was a little too tall<br>
        Could've used a few pounds<br>
        Tight pants points hardly reknown<br>
        She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes<br>
        And points all her own sitting way up high<br>
        Way up firm and high<br>
        Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy<br>
        Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy<br>
        Workin' on mysteries without any clues<br>
        Workin' on our night moves<br>
        Trying' to make some front page drive-in news<br>
        Workin' on our night moves in the summertime<br>
        In the sweet summertime<br>
        We weren't in love oh no far from it<br>
        We weren't searching for some pie in the sky summit<br>
        We were just young and restless and bored<br>
        Living by the sword<br>
        And we'd steal away every chance we could<br>
        To the backroom, the alley, the trusty woods<br>
        I used her she used me<br>
        But neither one cared<br>
        We were getting our share<br>
        Workin' on our night moves<br>
        Trying to lose the awkward teenage blues<br>
        Workin' on out night moves<br>
        In the summertime<br>
        And oh the wonder<br>
        Felt the lightning<br>
        And we waited on the thunder<br>
        Waited on the thunder<br>
        I woke last night to the sound of thunder<br>
        How far off I sat and wondered<br>
        Started humming a song from 1962<br>
        Ain't it funny how the night moves<br>
        When you just don't seem to have as much to lose<br>
        Strange how the night moves<br>
        With autumn closing in</p>
